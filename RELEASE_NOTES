# Description of changes per release
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

961113
	Portability fix.
		Trying to include <strings.h> was a bit over-ambitious
		and caused confusion on some platforms.
		There are no functional changes in this release.

961013
	Bug fix.
		Fix parsespec() handling of source routes and uucp bang
		paths. Must copy plain address before checking domain.
		Bug was introduced in version 961006.
	Minor fixes.
		Improve interrupt and error handling in I/O routines.
		Reject MX records of the wrong resource record class.
	Miscellaneous changes.
		Attempt to further reduce lint clutter. It is difficult
		to eliminate this altogether. There are too many subtle
		differences between various platforms.

961006
	Support for ESMTP EHLO command.
		Optionally use the ESMTP EHLO command instead of HELO.
		This is forced via the new -H command line option.
	Support for ESMTP ETRN command.
		A new -T option enables special ETRN processing at the
		mx hosts for a given domain. See RFC 1985 for details.
		Suggested by Robert Harker <harker@harker.com>
	Configurable default options.
		Use an environment variable VRFY_DEFAULTS to set
		default options and parameters. These are interpolated
		in front of the command line arguments before scanning.
		Syntax is the same as the command line syntax.
	More environment variables.
		Use environment variables to overrule the compiled-in
		names of the local mail host and several relay hosts.
	More configurable defaults.
		The default compiled-in connect and read timeout are
		now configurable in conf.h.
	Properly handle tcp packet overflow.
		If the supplied answer buffer space is insufficient to
		store the entire answer, res_send() is supposed to
		return the length of the entire untruncated answer, not
		the number of bytes that are actually available.
	Increase MAXPACKET packet buffer size.
		The traditional value 1024 for the (tcp) packet size is
		no longer sufficient (see moderators.uu.net MX records).
		This is now set to the maximum value used internally
		by the BIND named. The same value is used by dig.
		Although still static, it should be sufficient.
	Extra safety checks.
		After a positive return from an ordinary gethostbyname
		or gethostbyaddr we cannot be absolutely sure that the
		size of the canonical h_name is within bounds.
	Attempt to recognize list (group) syntax.
		Not many smtp servers are able to handle this properly.
		Try to extract the pure address list from this syntax.
	Better diagnose SMTP reply codes.
		Code 252 was added per RFC 1123 to reject an SMTP VRFY
		command. This has been implemented by sendmail V8.
		Consider only 250 and 251 as valid responses.
	Minor changes.
		Check some more SMTP reply codes.
		Guard against potential buffer overflow in some places.
		Make some extra domain name syntax checks.
	Miscellaneous cleanup.
		Update pieces of code and header files to be similar to
		those used in the host/ping/traceroute utilities.
		Add various BIND portability fixes.
	Update manual page.
		Document the old -h option and the new -H option.
		Document the new -T option for ETRN processing.
		Document the new environment variables.

950410
	Increase various constants.
		Change MAXSPEC from 256 to 512.
		Change MAXMXHOSTS from 10 to 20 conforming to sendmail.
	Refine test for invalid address.
		Disallow only unquoted control characters.
		No embedded newlines without linear white space.
	Add smtprset().
		Issue an SMTP RSET command after MAIL and RCPT during
		the alternative protocol suite, to reset the session.
	Miscellaneous glitches.
		Properly allocate static storage for mx host names.
		Allow DNS name expansion up to MAXHOST characters.
		Explicitly call res_init() early in the game.
	Added this RELEASE_NOTES file.

940929
	Various portability changes.
		Avoid use of sizeof() for all entities that have a fixed
		field width, and use predefined constants instead. This
		is necessary for systems without 16 or 32 bit integers.
		Fix use of ipaddr_t and struct in_addr appropriately.
		All this makes the utility portable to e.g. Cray.

940525
	General portability changes.
		Adapt for DEC Alpha OSF/1, and BIND 4.9.
		Add header files port.h conf.h exit.h
	Miscellaneous additions.
		Configure relay host for unresolved single hostnames.
		Handle 8-bit characters and sendmail V8 meta-chars.
		Some error messages slightly modified.
		In exit status, temp failures override hard failures.

921021
	Miscellaneous declaration changes.
	Add -e option for expn instead of vrfy.
	Various sanity checks.
	Fix bug in recursion: save old host.
	Add version number to all files.

920229
	Support parsing of full addresses.
	Add -f option to verify address files.
	Add -l option to handle errors locally.
	Implement recursive mode.
	Detect forwarding loops.
	Add -s option to strip comments.
	Improve recursive loop strategy.
	Add undocumented -h -o -m -r options.
	Add -n option for alternative suite.

911216
	Fetch MX records and verify remotely.
	Catch special pseudo-domains.
	Add -c option to set connect timeout.
	Add -p option to ping mx hosts.

910617
	Add -t option to set read timeout.
	Save errno across smtpquit() calls.
